		A portable library of functor and monad transformers, inspired by
		the paper
		
		* \&quot;Functional Programming with Overloading and Higher-Order
		Polymorphism\&quot;, by Mark P Jones,
		in /Advanced School of Functional Programming/, 1995
		(&lt;http://web.cecs.pdx.edu/~mpj/pubs/springschool.html&gt;).
		
		This package contains:
		
		* the monad transformer class (in &quot;Control.Monad.Trans.Class&quot;)
		
		* concrete functor and monad transformers, each with associated
		operations and functions to lift operations associated with other
		transformers.
		
		The package can be used on its own in portable Haskell code, in
		which case operations need to be manually lifted through transformer
		stacks (see &quot;Control.Monad.Trans.Class&quot; for some examples).
		Alternatively, it can be used with the non-portable monad classes in
		the @mtl@ or @monads-tf@ packages, which automatically lift operations
		introduced by monad transformers through other transformers.
