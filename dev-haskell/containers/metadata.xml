		This package contains efficient general-purpose implementations
		of various immutable container types including sets, maps, sequences,
		trees, and graphs.
		
		For a walkthrough of what this package provides with examples of common
		operations see the [containers
		introduction](https://haskell-containers.readthedocs.io).
		
		The declared cost of each operation is either worst-case or amortized, but
		remains valid even if structures are shared.
