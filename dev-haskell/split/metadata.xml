		A collection of various methods for splitting
		lists into parts, akin to the \&quot;split\&quot; function
		found in several mainstream languages. Here is
		its tale:
		
		Once upon a time the standard &quot;Data.List&quot; module
		held no function for splitting a list into parts
		according to a delimiter.  Many a brave
		lambda-knight strove to add such a function, but
		their striving was in vain, for Lo, the Supreme
		Council fell to bickering amongst themselves what
		was to be the essential nature of the One True
		Function which could cleave a list in twain (or
		thrain, or any required number of parts).
		
		And thus came to pass the split package,
		comprising divers functions for splitting a list
		asunder, each according to its nature.  And the
		Supreme Council had no longer any grounds for
		argument, for the favored method of each was
		contained therein.
		
		To get started, see the &quot;Data.List.Split&quot; module.
