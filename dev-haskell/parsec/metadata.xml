		Parsec is designed from scratch as an industrial-strength parser
		library.  It is simple, safe, well documented (on the package
		homepage), has extensive libraries, good error messages,
		and is fast.  It is defined as a monad transformer that can be
		stacked on arbitrary monads, and it is also parametric in the
		input stream type.
		
		The main entry point is the &quot;Text.Parsec&quot; module which provides
		defaults for parsing &#39;Char&#39;acter data.
		
		The &quot;Text.ParserCombinators.Parsec&quot; module hierarchy contains
		the legacy @parsec-2@ API and may be removed at some point in
		the future.
