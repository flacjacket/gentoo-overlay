		Software Transactional Memory, or STM, is an abstraction for
		concurrent communication. The main benefits of STM are
		/composability/ and /modularity/. That is, using STM you can write
		concurrent abstractions that can be easily composed with any other
		abstraction built using STM, without exposing the details of how
		your abstraction ensures safety. This is typically not the case
		with other forms of concurrent communication, such as locks or
		&#39;MVar&#39;s.
