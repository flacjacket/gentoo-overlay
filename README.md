Gentoo Overlay
==============

These are a couple simple ebuilds I have cooked up for a few projects that I
work on or use that aren't in the portage tree.  The ebuilds Work For Me, use
at your own risk.

To use, copy flacjacket.xml to `/etc/layman/overlays/`, run `layman -S`, then
`layman -a flacjacket`.
